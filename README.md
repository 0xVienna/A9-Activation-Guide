# A9 Activation Guide
## (The solution for 64-bit A9 Devices having issues uploading activation files to mnt2 on iOS 9.2-9.3.3)
An easy to follow guide which achieves official activation status and an untethered jailbreak (kokeshi9 untethered)

## Benefits (why you should try this method)
- App Store works (by installing iTunesStoreFix in Ca1 repo)
- Gives you the real iOS 9 experience on your A9 devices
- Allows a full untethered jailbreak
- Setup.app will not be bypassed and you will be able to complete it as if the device is activated

## Prerequisites
- An A9 device: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s/6s Plus, iPad 5th Generation
- A computer running macOS or Linux; Most AMD CPUs will not work due to its USB interfaces not supporting gaster/other pwning methods; Windows also will not work as we need to use many tools
- iOS 9.2-9.3.3 IPSW File
- turdus_merula
- Legacy iOS Kit
- A stable internet connection
- 4 Activation Tickets from iOS 10+: [4 tickets](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegacyJailbreak/wiki/guides/a9ios9activation/#wiki_saving_activation_tickets)
- 1 Hacktivation Key in MobileGestalt.plist: [iPh0ne4s](https://www.reddit.com/r/setupapp/comments/1jviq3i/guide_manually_jailbreaking_ios_92933_unactivated/)
- Mac with AirDrop; iOS 9 is super restrictive while it is deactivated, therefore we will need to use AirDrop to send the activation files

## Frequently asked questions
### Why is iOS 9.2-9.3.3 only supported?
This is because iOS 9 in deactivated state does not allow us to sideload apps or even install apps from websites like jailbreaks.app/. Hence, we will need to use jbme.ddw.nu as a temporary jailbreak to place the activation files, set permissions and user access.

### Why do I need to restore to iOS 10.3.3+ first to obtain activation tickets?
Only iOS 10+ can be officially activated. Once you have jailbroken and have the 4 tickets uploaded and saved in a folder, you can keep it for older iOS activation.
